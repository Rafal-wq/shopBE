## Description

This is backend project of app Shop write in Nest.js.</br>
I just build this app so there’s only one stage here.</br>
I’m working on front app to this app, that’s appear soon.</br>
Unfortunately I have very little time to spend on it.</br>
But soon it will appear (I hope very soon).</br>
I will write it in React.js.

To download this BE app, write :

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Rafal-wq/shopBE.git
```

## Running the app

Before you run this app you need to download all of packages from packed.json .
Easily way to do this :

```bash
# development
$ npm install
```

Next you need to create database (ex: mysql, mysql2) and config it in src / config / config.example.ts .
There you find default settings to do this (change them to make it work properly.)

To run :

```bash
# development
$ nest start
```

# watch mode
```bash
# development
$ nest start --watch
```
